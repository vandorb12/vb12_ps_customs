# vb12_ps_customs
Custom songs and chart files to be used in the rhythm game Phase Shift, Clone Hero, and others that use the HMX MIDI standard.

Charts are started by me, but open to pull and edit on GitHub. I'll merge branches after some QA testing on my end.

Some charts are based off of copywrited works, and therefore their media files will not be included. 
Works that I have been licensed to chart for (yes, that's a thing), or have been granted permission will have media files if I have been allowed to do so. Some may not want me to distribute stems, some may not want me to distribute any audio but allow me to provide you "instructions" on how to get the necessary files. It's a grab bag here, folks.
Songs will maintain their own use license within their subfolder and it's important that you, dear reader, read and understand them.

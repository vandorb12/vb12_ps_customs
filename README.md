# vb12_ps_customs
Custom songs and chart files to be used in the rhythm game Phase Shift, Clone Hero, and others that use the HMX MIDI standard.

Charts are usually started by me, but open to pull and edit on GitHub. I'll merge branches after some QA testing on my end.

Some charts are based off of copywrited works, and therefore their mediafiles will not be included nor will the instructions
on how to obtain these files. Works that I have been licensed to chart for (yes, that's a thing) will have media files. Those songs
will maintain their own use license within their subfolder and it's important that you, dear reader, adhear to them.
